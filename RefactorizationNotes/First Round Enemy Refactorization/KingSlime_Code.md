# Player Code Notes
## First Impressions
 - Jump function is hell
  - Make this more elegant

## Forming Ideas & Digging Deeper
 - Could use a parabola type equation to determine the jump height in jump

## Final Tasks
 - [ ] Normalize function/variable names
 - [ ] Give some order to where the functions go
 - [ ] Research and implement a better means for the jump function that acts similar (if not better)

## Hard tasks Reserved for Later
 - [ ] Branching in activity makes for slow code. Would be nice to reduce this somewhat
